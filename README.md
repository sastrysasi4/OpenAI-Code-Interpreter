# OpenAI Code Interpreter 

In this project, we will see how to add a Code Interpreter to the LLM Model with the help of Agents.

## Installation

These are the required packages

* Langchain
* Langchain_experimental
* OpenAI
* Qrcode
* Pandas
* Tabulate

## Documentation


We'll look at how to include Code and CSV Agents into LLMs in this section. Langchain and Langchain-experimental libraries are being used for these Agents. We are also employing Grand-Agent to make self-decisions based on the user query. We're using the OpenAI API and its Calling Functions here.

For the testing Code Agent, we have asked to create a QR code for the Udemy website, and for the CSV Agent, we have asked questions about the provided CSV file. Agent-type is getting from OpenAI function calling.

## Features

* Model -- ChatOpenAI API
* Code Agent -- Langchain_experimental 
* CSV Agent -- Langchain_experimental
* Agent_Type -- OpenAI_Function
